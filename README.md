<h2>Driving School Information Management System with Customer Support Chat Function</h2>

Local Driving School organization’s service is currently using a manual way of providing services with their enrollment process for driving lessons. The manual way, on the other hand, could not meet the high demands of the customers, especially during peak conditions. To address this concern, the proponents developed a Driving School Information System, a web-based online system for any driving school to facilitate a more straightforward workflow in the Local Driving School.

Our objectives are...
<ul>
  <li>To create a system enabling driving schools to store and manage users’ data electronically.</li>
  <li>To develop a system that will act as a management and repository for the student's driving enrollment records.</li>
  <li>The system will make it easier to manage scheduled driving lessons for students.</li>
  <li>To generate driving lesson results.</li>
  <li>The system caters to customer support chat functions.</li>
</ul>
